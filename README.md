# transcript-to-audio

An experimental project to convert youtube transcripts to audio in other languages.

# How to use

1. create an input folder and output folder
2. Place transcript.txt into the input folder (you have to select the transcripts file from youtube.com)
3. run node index.js in terminal

I have only tested this for linux. It works and generates an output file in output folder
